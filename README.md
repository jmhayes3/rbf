## Overview 
RBF is a framework for building and managing bots that interface with Reddit. It is designed to be simple to use, and simple to extend.

This project was started with two primary goals in mind:
1. Lower the barrier to entry for creating Reddit bots (no coding required).
2. Be scalable without depending on third-party cloud services.
