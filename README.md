# Reddit Bot Framework (RBF)
![build](https://github.com/jmhayes3/rbf/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

RBF is a framework for building and orchestrating bots that interface with Reddit. It is designed to be simple to use, and simple to extend.

This project was started with two primary goals in mind:
1. Lower the barrier to entry for creating bots (no coding required).
2. Be as scalable as possible without relying on third-party cloud services.
